Multiple genome alignment provides a basis for research into comparative genomics and the study of evolutionary dynamics.  Aligning whole genomes is a fundamentally different problem than aligning short sequences.  Mauve has been developed with the idea that a multiple genome aligner should require only modest computational resources. It employs algorithmic techniques that scale well in the amount of sequence being aligned. For example, a pair of Y. pestis genomes can be aligned in under a minute, while a group of 9 divergent Enterobacterial genomes can be aligned in a few hours."

For each read, potentially matching segments in the reference are identified from seed matches in the index and subsequently aligned with the read using a banded Smith-Waterman algorithm. Reads from a wide range of sequencing platforms, for example Illumina, Roche-454, Ion Torrent, PacBio or ABI-Sanger, can be processed including paired-end reads. "

Trinity partitions the sequence data into many individual de Bruijn graphs, each representing the transcriptional complexity at at a given gene or locus, and then processes each graph independently to extract full-length splicing isoforms and to tease apart transcripts derived from paralogous genes."

It provides visualization modules for biological objects such as annotated genome sequences, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) assembly data, multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetic trees and 3D structures. Most of the integrated algorithms are tuned for maximum performance by the usage of multithreading and special processor instructions. UGENE includes a visual environment for creating reusable workflows that can be launched on local resources or in a High Performance Computing (HPC) environment."

    about="Cross_match is a program for rapid protein and nucleic acid sequence comparison and database search, based on an efficient implementation of the Smith-Waterman-Gotoh algorithm (Smith &amp; Waterman 1981, Gotoh 1982). By revising the recursion relations slightly and making efficient use of word-packing, we have been able to significantly reduce the number of machine instructions executed per Smith-Waterman matrix cell, resulting in a speed enhancement of 2-3 fold over the previous best implementation (Pearson and Miller, 1992)."

Current repeat identification software is sensitive but slow, creating a costly bottleneck in large-scale analyses. We have developed MaskerAid, a software enhancement to RepeatMasker that increased the speed of masking more than 30-fold at the most sensitive setting."
