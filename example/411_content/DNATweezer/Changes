    * *-manipulations.pl, *Manipulations.pm
        - Major: To avoid EXPORTing, and other issues, all *::Subs are now
        *Manipulations.pm, and are "require"d by all wrapper scripts that
        currently have one (pop- and seq-)
        - Minor: Replaced all instances of "use Modern::Perl" with "use 5.010".
        This avoids needing to install a somewhat useless package, but with the
        same effect. All users of these scripts *must* use at least Perl 5.10.
        - Minor: Some cleanup, minor optimizations.
        - Other: Code in overhauled seq- and pop- manipulations can still be
        a bit ugly or inefficient in places. These are certainly WIP: please
        test!
        
    TODO:
        - Tests have not yet been written for any of the *Manipulations.pm
        files. This was the pricipal reason for splitting them like this, but
        it has yet to be done.
        - The example sections for all wrapper scripts is still empty.
Jun 16, 2011 [yozen]
    * pop-manipulations.pl, PopMan::Subs
        - Feature: Added support for KaKs methods in Bio::Align::DNAStatistics.
        Simply use --kaks option with the type of calculation you wish to
        perform: "all-pairs", "pair", "average". "pair" requires use of
        "ingroup"/"outgroup" (or its more convenient aliases").
        - Minor: Slightly altered behavior of distance option. Now dies if
        an invalid distance method is specified (default behavior in
        Bio::Align::DNAStatistics is to warn and continue).
        - Docs: Updated documentation, fixed typo in "dist-method" name.
        - Known issues: Unknown if this is an issue in Bio::Align::DNAStatistics
        but using --kaks="all-pairs" or ="average" seems to cause division by 0
        errors. Will continue investigating.
Jun 09, 2011 [yozen]
    * pop-manipulations.pl, PopMan::Subs
        - Feature: Added options for MK test simulation, "simmk". From a script
        written by Dr. Qiu.
        - Feature: Added "distance" and "dist-method" options. These use 
        Bio::Align::DNAStatistics->distance to get a pairwise distance matrix
        from the input alignment and print it to the screen. "dist-method"
        controls the method used when calculating the distance.
        - Major: Changed name of --sample_size to --sample-size
        - Bugfix: Fixed a bug in simmk where the variance for the between group
        Ka/Ks was taken from the mean from within-group Ka/Ks (from group 2)
        instead of from the mean Ka/Ks between groups.

Jun 03, 2011 [yozen]
    * pop-manipulations.pl, PopMan::Subs
        - Major: Added options for MK test and Tajima's D, as well as an option
        for getting the percent of mismatches between all pairs of sequences
        in the input alignment. The latter was ported from Dr. Qiu's pop-stats
        script. The internal function for performing the MK test came from there
        as well.
        - Major: Due to a bug in Bio::PopGen::Statistics, using a fixed local
        version altered by Dr. Qiu. This file will be added to GenomeTools until
        the bug is fixed upstream.
        - Minor: Several other minor changes.
        - Bugfix: Fixed an issue where attempting to use a sample size bigger
        than the size of the outgroup caused PopGenStatistics to attempt to
        access undefined values and use them as objects.
        - Docs: Documented new features.
    * New files:
        - PopGenStatistics.pm: modified version of upstream
        Bio::PopGen::Statistics. This file is merged from upstream and local
        changes Dr. Qiu used to fix a bug.
        - t/test_pop.mk.fa: A new testing file.

May 14, 2011 [yozen]
    * SeqMan::Subs
        - Minor: Favoring 'use 5.010_000;' over 'use Modern::Perl' for two
        reasons: 1) No need to install new modules, 2) only other potential
        benefit is in additional import of mro, which is not relevant in any of
        these modules.
        - Minor: Using new translate() API: explicit use of -frame option.
        - Docs: Begin adding POD docs.
    * PopMan::Subs
        - Minor: Favoring 'use 5.010_000;' over 'use Modern::Perl'.
        - Docs: Begin adding POD docs.

May 8, 2011 [yozen]
    * seq-manipulations.pl
        - Bugfix: Fixed handling of prefix flag (and subsequently, anonymize)

May 4, 2011 [yozen]
    * seq-manipulations.pl
        - Major: All functions now in new module: SeqMan::Subs (we'll find a better
        name later).

May 2, 2011 [yozen]
    * seq-manipulations.pl
        - Major: Moved remaining options to functions.
        - Major: Moved option handling to a dispatch hash as well.

Apr 20, 2011 [yozen]
    * tree-manipulations.pl
        - Major: Reorganized code to use subroutines.
        - Major: Separated options which exit without printing a tree from those
        that do using blocks. Future options can be added in one of these two
        labeled blocks depending on the expected result.
        - Minor: Using "Perl Best Practices" style with perltidy.
        - Bugfix: Some options used to print trees twice.
        - Bugfix: Should no longer print excessive warnings when removing nodes
        in 'bootclean' option.
        - Feature: Added new option "rmbl", remove branch lengths. For any nodes
        which have a branch length defined, the length is set to 0.
        - Removal: 'text' option deprecated as it was redundant. The same effect
        can be achieved by using '-o newick', and most options print trees anyway.
    * New files
        - Added a t/ directory with some test trees in it. This marks the beginning
        of building a test suite for GenomeTools.

Apr 19, 2011 [yozen]
    * seq-manipulations.pl
        -Minor: Testing perltidy formatting using format suggested by "Perl
        Best Practices"

Apr 13, 2011 [yozen]
    * seq-manipulations.pl
        - Major: Merge finished: experimenting with dispatching sub calls when
        picking and deleting.
    * SeqMan::Subs.pl
        - New file to this branch
    * pop-manipulations.pl
        - New file to this branch.
        - Basic layout in this script done.
        - Options are still being added
        - No documentation yet
    * PopMan::Subs.pl
        - New file to this branch
        - Basic layout, minimal functions added
        - Preliminary statistics printing (NOT robust)

Apr 8, 2011 [yozen]
    * seq-manipulations.pl
        - Major: In progress of merging --pick and --del. Script may be broken
        right now!

Apr 7, 2011 [yozen]
    * aln-manipulations.pl
        - Minor: Removed some commented pragmas.
    * seq-manipulations.pl
        - Minor: Removed "waiting for input from standard input" warning as it
        was too noisy.

Apr 5, 2011 [yozen]
    * seq-manipulations.pl
        - New Feature: --prefix. Used in conjunction with --anonymize, allows
        the user to specify a custom prefix. Gives a warning if at least one
        anonymized ID exceeds the value given to --anonymize.
        - Minor: Using perltidy on seq-manipulations as well.
        - Docs: Added documentation on new --prefix feature

Apr 4, 2011 [yozen]
    * aln-manipulations.pl
        - New Feature: --rsample (-e) option: Now you can ask for a random
        sample of n sequences from the input alignment by specifying the
        --rsample option followed by a number. If the number is omitted, then
        half of the sequences in the alignment (rounded down) are chosen at
        random. This feature makes use of the Reservoir Sampling algorithm.
        - Minor: More cleanup
        - Docs: Added documentation on new --rsample feature

Mar 31, 2011 [yozen]
    * aln-manipulations.pl
        - Major: Removed 'watterson' option. Unused, and unimplemented anyway.
        - Minor: More cleanup, hopefully clearer code in codon-view

Mar 22, 2011 [yozen, branch yozen]
    * aln-manipulations.pl
        - Major: Move to replace @flags with $flags. Since @flags was
        essentially used as a mask, use a string instead which is easier
        to use in that way. Minor performance gain by avoidng calls to:
        Bio::Seq->subseq and push. Using regex's for masking and string
        concatenation for building mask string.
        - Minor: Minor fixes to code.
        - Cleanup: Used perltidy in attempt to standardize code style.
        - Docs: Adding some subroutine documentation; more comments to clarify
        new code.

Mar 01, 2011 [yozen, branch yozen]
    * aln-manipulations.pl
        - Minor: More cleanup
        - Added some FIXME tags, for points of ambiguity or where some part
        of the program's function is a bit questionable.

Mar 01, 2011 [yozen, branch yozen]
    * aln-manipulations.pl
        - Minor: Removed unnecessary passing of $aln in some of the new sub's.

Mar 01, 2011 [yozen, branch yozen]
    * aln-manipulations.pl
        - Major: Added 'use Modern::Perl' pragma. Now aln-manipulations.pl
        requires at least Perl 5.10
        - Major: Beginning other changes which will "modernize" (in the
        broadest sense) aln-manipulations.pl, making future changes easier.
        - Minor: No longer warn when expecting input from STDIN
        - Minor: Hopefully increase some readability when opening input.
        - Minor: Using say() instead of print(..,"\n")
        - Minor: Moved query for SimpleAlign::num_sequences to only places
        where it is needed: if -n is given or if -y is. This way, it is not
        needlessly calculated every time.

Jan 20, 2011 [yozen]
    * seq-manipulations.pl
        - Workaround: Added explicit filehandle for STDOUT in the $seq_out
        declaration. This became necessary after a change in SeqIO. Thanks
        to Che and Dr. Qiu for finding the problem.

Nov 3, 2010 [yozen]
    * aln-manipulations.pl
        - Bugfix: Fixed a bug where --pick wouldn't actually pick out the
        requested sequences. Thanks to Che for finding the bug.

Oct 28, 2010 [weigang]
    * seq-manipulations.pl
        - Feature: --order option now accepts range. Merged from SVN by Yozen.

Oct 18, 2010 [yozen]
    * align_concatenate.pl
        - Bugfix: Fixed bug in --uc option where lowercase sequences would not
        be converted to uppercase.
        - Bugfix: Fixed potential bug introduced by the fix above. When checking
        $lowercase variable, should just check if it is non-zero, not exactly
        equal to 1.

Oct 13, 2010 [yozen]
    * align_concatenate.pl
        - Feature: Added --lc and --uc options for lowercase and uppercase
        sequences respectively.
        - Feature: Added --ref, -r option for picking the reference sequence in
        the new concatenated alignment. Previously, the reference depended on
        whatever was the reference in the very first alignment file given.
        - Feature: Added --safe (or --safe-names, or -s) option. When given,
        this option strips sequence ID's of potentially problematic characters.
        - Doc: Added documentation for all new features.
    * aln-manipulations.pl
        - Minor: It appears Bio::SimpleAlign has changed since the --ref option
        in this script was written, because this is now a function. Changed this
        option for make use of that function, potentially improving performance
        (depending, of course, on how efficient the BioPerl method is).
        
Oct 12, 2010 [yozen]
    * aln-manipulations.pl
        - Feature: In --uniq option, the name map as provided by Bio::SimpleAlign
        is now provided on STDERR (standard error).
        
        As an example of usage, it is now possible to do:
            aln-manipulations -u file.aln > output 2>uniq_names
        and have the output go to "output" with the name map in "uniq_maps"

Oct 10, 2010 [yozen]
    * align_concatenate.pl
        - Minor: Comment fix, incorrect description of a variable. 

Oct 07, 2010 [yozen]
    * Previous change by Dr. Qiu ported from SVN by yozen

Oct 05, 2010 [weigang]
    * aln-manipulations.pl
        - Added --uniq or -u

Oct 05, 2010 [yozen]
    * align_concatenate.pl
        - **Major: Rewrote large parts of align_concatenate.pl
        - Bugfix: Fixed bug where concatenated alignment might not have updated
          positions, causing Bio::AlignIO to throw an exception when writing.
        - Doc: Updated documentation.

Oct 04, 2010 [yozen]
    * NEW FILE: align_concatenate.pl

Sep 15, 2010 [yozen]
    * draw-align.pl
        - Shouldn't depend on local Graphics.pm, or use /home/shared as a lib.
    * aln-manipulations.pl
        - **Major: Output format changed: now includes end window position:
        Ex: start   stop    pi

Sep 06, 2010 [yozen]
    * aln-manipulations.pl
        - Feature: Added "window" option based on Dr. Qiu's implementation.
        - Doc: Added documentation for window option.
        - Code: Cleaned up window option code, a few other spots.
    * seq-manipulations.pl
        - Doc: Added documentation for regex matching in --pick and --del
        options.
        - Code: Cleaned up code a bit, standardizing separator comments.
    Merged with main.

May 31, 2010 [yozen]
    * align_coding_seq.pl
        - Bugfix: Removed an old method for determining output filenames which
        caused input files not following expected naming schemes to be truncated.
        - Feature: Output no longer to a fixed filename based on the input files,
        output is to STDOUT. Optional FASTA output now goes to a file called
        <input alignment>.cds

May 20, 2010 [yozen]
    * seq-manipulations.pl
        - Feature: Now possible to use regular expressions to pick or delete
        sequences
        - TODO: documentation for the new feature.

Apr 20, 2010 [yozen]
    * aln-manipulations.pl
        - Feature: Allow consensus option to be configurable, changing 50 to be
        a default value. (Fixes issue #21 in Google Code tacker).
        - Feature: New shorthand for "codon-view" option: -b.

Apr 13, 2010 [yozen]
    * aln-manipulations.pl
        - Bugfix: (Thanks, Levy!) Fixed a bug where alignments with length not
        divisible by three had their final position number offset when using
        the codon-view option.
        - Minor: Removed warning for alignments not divisible by 3.
        - Minor: Made padding for block start position labels more robust.
        - Doc: Updated documentation to reflect bugfix. Removed BETA tag.
        - Doc: Updated documentation to remove mention of highlighting (won't
        implement).

Apr 12, 2010 [yozen]
    * aln-manipulations.pl
        - Minor: Minor code annotations, comments.
        - Minor: Minor code cleanup in sub draw_codon_view
        - Minor: Renamed sub print_end_pos to print_positions

Apr 06, 2010 [yozen]
    * aln-manipulations.pl
        - Doc: Fixed documentation formatting error.

Apr 06, 2010 [yozen]
    * aln-manipulations.pl
        - Bugfix: Newline now prints after last iteration
        - Feature: Left-hand count now appears in codon-view.
        - Feature: codon-view option issues a warning when input alignment legnth
        is not divisible by 3.
        - Doc: Changed documentation to reflect limitation in codon-view. Fixed
        SVN tags left in documentation.

Apr 06, 2010 [yozen]
    * aln-manipulations.pl
        - Feature: Added codon-view option. Should still be considered beta,
        issues a warning to STDERR when run. If invoked as --codon-view=n where
        n is some number, will print n codons per line. Other normally stackable
        options, such as -m, can be used along side it. If piping through
        aln-manipulations.pl, ensure codon-view is the last invocation.
        - Doc: Added documentation for codon-view.

Mar 26, 2010 [yozen]
    * seq-manipulations.pl
        - Minor: Changed how default value for anonymize functionality is assigned.
        Takes advantage of Getopt::Long features.
    * aln-manipulations.pl
        - WIP: Began work on codon-view option and implementation. This might not make
        it to trunk, as the implementaion might better be suited for another place
        (such as Bio::SimpleAlign, or a new Bio::AlignIO handler).

Mar 24, 2010 [yozen]
    * aln-manipulations.pl, seq-manipulations.pl
        - Doc: Clarified documentation on default file formats.
        - Doc: Added a documentation stub for usage examples. Will be expanded on later.

Mar 23, 2010 [yozen]
    * aln-manipulations.pl, seq-manipulations.pl
        - Bugfix: Reverted distinction between action and passive options so that these
        scripts can be used as format converters.
    * Merge with trunk.

Mar 22, 2010 [yozen]
    Merge with main.
    * aln-manipulations.pl
        - Bugfix: Added two lines in the variable sites option block which get the
        end value for a new LocatableSeq object (as calculated by the LocatableSeq::end
        subroutine) and set it using the same sub in a new LocatableSeq object, in
        order to allow the match code block (and perhaps others) to use the resulting
        alignment object. (Fixes issue #19 in Google Code tacker).
        - Doc: Added documentation for new option "avgpercentid", and renamed it from
        the previous "avepercentid".
        - Minor: Renamed long version of "slice" option from "sub" to "slice".
    * aln-manipulations.pl, seq-manipulations.pl
        - Merge with trunk to prepare for reintegration
        - Minor: Fixed some typos
        - Minor: Added a distinction between other options (such as input or ouput) vs
        "action" options which actually work on the data. Now both scripts will
        give a warning and show a help message when no action options are given.

Mar 20, 2010 [yozen]
    * aln-manipulations.pl
        - Allow for one parameter in the slice option to be omitted. Default
        $begin to the beginning of the alignment, and $end to the end. (Fixes
        issue #20 in the Google Code tracker).

Mar 8, 2010 [yozen]
    * aln-manipulations.pl, seq-manipulations.pl
        - Scripts now issue warning if no options are given (since there is no
        default behavior and scripts do nothing with no options).

Mar 7, 2010 [yozen]
    * aln-manipulations.pl, seq-manipulations.pl
        - Fix waiting for standard in message even when filename is given

Feb 19, 2010 [yozen]
    * aln-manipulations.pl
        - Reverted previous change to no_seuquences in favor of "num_sequences", which is the
        newer function name. Any errors saying otherwise could indicate an older bioperl is being used
        - Added the ability to take input alignments directly from standard input
    * seq-manipulations.pl
        - Added the ability to take input sequences directly from standard input

Feb 09, 2010 [yozen]
    * aln-manipulations.pl
        - Updated aln-manipulations to use new method name "no_sequences" from Bio::SimpleAlign.

Nov 30, 2009 [yozen]
    Merged changes from branches/main
    * aln-manipulations.pl, seq-manipulations.pl
        - Fixed errors in POD documentation.

Nov 24, 2009 [yozen]
    * aln-manipulations.pl
        -Proper gap detection finally working. Partially tested, but looks like removing gaps works well,
        and does not assume "--var". Also, "--var"s funtionality is unaffected.
        -Further work is planned on optimization
    Further work is planned on seq-manipulations.pl to accept standard input without giving '-' as an argument.

Revision 19: Nov 11, 2009 [yozen]
    * aln-manipulations.pl
        -Turned part of the code in the "verbose" option block into a new subroutine:
        flag_sites(), which takes an Bio::Align object, and a reference to an array as arguments
        -Added a new option handling block for a stand-alone gap removal function. It uses
        the new subroutine mentioned above, but there is still some code repition.
        -TODO: Optimize code, and eliminate repetitive code, in the blocks mentioned above.
        -WARNING: The gap removal function hasn't been extensively tested -- please let me know
        your experiences using it.

November 13, 2009 [levy]
        * aln-manipulations.pl
                - Feature: Added multiple ID capability to the 'del' option. It now accepts a comma-separated
                list of sequence IDs.

November 9, 2009 [levy]
        * seq-manipulations.pl
                - Bugfix: Fixed POD formatting
                - Bugfix: Fixed Getopt::Long argument for serialization. Changed from mandatory integer
                to no optional value. The default of 10 is now functional.
                - Feature: Creates a sed command file which replaces the serial names with the original
                sequence id. The file is created in the current working directory with a '.sed' suffix
                appended to the filename argument. If the filename is not supplied, it defaults to stdout.sed.

Revision 17: Oct 11, 2009 [yozen]
    * seq-manipulations.pl
        - Removed 'use Getopt::Std' line -> deprecated by use of Getopt::Long
        - Added myself to list of authors, along with email address
        - Completely removed old ParseArgs() subroutine

    * aln-manipulations.pl
        - Bugfix: Fixed a bug which caused certain options (mainly -m, -v, -g, -q, and -w)
        if none of the other options apart from -i or -o were also given.
            - Details: Initialized $new_aln upon declaration.
            - Reason: -m and -v option handling blocks seem to assume $new_aln is already
            initialized by the time they are reached. To prevent interfereing with how they,
            and the other options work, $new_aln is now initialzed upon declaration.
        - Bugfix: Fixed a bug where giving -v without -g would produce warnings from
        Bio::SimpleAlign about inconsistent sequence lengths and end() values.
            - Details: Removed manual setting of end parameter.
            - Reason: Setting end parameter manually for some reason gave the wrong value
            for sequence length. Creating a new Bio::LocatableSeq omitting a value for
            this parameter works fine, as it is guessed correctly later.
        - Changed over to using Getopt::Long. Removed any references to Getopt::Std.
